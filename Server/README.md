NOTE - .air.toml is for using [Air - Live reload for Go apps](https://github.com/air-verse/air).

.air.toml has been configured to auto-run the entrypoint of the backend which is ./cmd/main.go so you can just run `air` command or go over [here](https://github.com/air-verse/air?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) if you dont have air installed
